 * are declared in RFC 3986: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986
 * We are using the term "URL" instead of "URI" as this is more common in web applications
 * and we do not need to distinguish them as the difference is mostly semantical and
 * less technical. Generating URIs, i.e. representation-independent resource identifiers,
 * is also possible.
